#dont forget to import all the neccesary lib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import matplotlib
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np etc.....
most imp follow this steps 
1. Dataset Selection
Choose a dataset suitable for classification tasks. (e.g., Iris dataset, Breast Cancer dataset)
2.Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset into Python using libraries like Pandas.
Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3.Model Training
Use scikit-learn to train a Decision Tree classifier on the training data.
Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) to optimize the model
4.Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the Decision Tree using libraries like Matplotlib or Graphviz to understand the learned decision rules.
5.Interpretation and Discussion
Interpret the Decision Tree structure and discuss the important features and decision rules learned by the model.
Discuss any observations or insights gained from the model evaluation process.
Address potential challenges or limitations encountered during the workshop.
